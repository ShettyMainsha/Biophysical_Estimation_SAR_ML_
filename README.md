In this project, Combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 with ML models was used for estimating biophysical parameters in mango orchards situated in Siyana, Uttar Pradesh, India. The primary objective of this project is to leverage advanced remote sensing technology and ML algorithms to improve the accuracy of biophysical parameter estimation in mango orchards. These parameters are crucial for monitoring crop health, yield prediction, and managing agricultural practices effectively.
